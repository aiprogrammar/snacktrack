You will act as an expert Flutter developer to help me build a prototype for a mobile app called SnackTrack, designed for self-service tuc shop tracking via QR scanning and Google Sheets integration. The app is for internal use only, targeting Android and iOS platforms.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Build a core prototype with the following features:

Simple login using email + 4-digit PIN

QR scanning to identify product

Item detail lookup from a local JSON file

Confirm purchase and log to Google Sheets via Apps Script Web App

View userâ€™s transaction history from the Google Sheet

ðŸ”„ User Flow:
On first use, user logs in with email + PIN (saved via shared_preferences)

User scans product QR code (e.g., https://snackscan.app/log?item=snickers)

App extracts item ID and looks up item details (name and price) from a bundled JSON file

Quantity input (default = 1) is shown, user taps "Confirm"

App sends POST request to backend with: timestamp, email, item, quantity, total price

App fetches and displays userâ€™s transactions

ðŸ“„ Local Item Lookup (sample assets/items.json):
